# Project Title: 
Clicky-Disney-Game

## Description: 
To create a memory game with React. This assignment requires to break up the application UI into components, manage
component store, and respond to user events.

## How it works?

The application renders different Disney characters images to the screen. The application tracks user's score
when an image is clicked for the first time. Every time an image is clicked, the images are shuffled in a random order. 
When user clicked the same image, the game is over and score is reset back to zero.
